                <h1>Why I Came Up With This Website?</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        COVID-19 has changed our life in many profound ways. As Singapore pivots from a strategy of ring-fencing-and-containing to co-existing with the virus, it's important that we continue living our life to the fullest, while taking all precautions to stay
                        safe. As a lover of hotel staycations and a hospitality professional, I want to help Singapore residents to easily find hotels outside COVID-19 and dengue clusters, plan their activities and enjoy life by knowing and avoiding high-to-medium-risk
                        areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website aims to provide Singapore residents with location-specific information on COVID-19 clusters and dengue fever clusters, and hotels approved for staycation and hotels opened for Stay-Home-Notice overseas travellers.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        The main function is an interactive map that allows user to do the following things:
                        <li>Click on a control to see all hotels in Singapore, hotels approved for staycation, hotels opened for overseas travelers who need to serve Stay-Home-Notice at dedicated facilities and staycation-approved hotels which are not opened
                            for Stay-Home-Notice.</li>
                        <li>Click on a control to see COVID-19 clusters of the recent days.</li>
                        <li>Click on a control to see dengue clusters of the recent days.</li>
                        <li>Search for any location, address or building in Singapore, with the map layers selected by the user, as descrbied above.</li>
                        <li>Find links to official websites on COVID-19, dengue fevers, staycation-approved hotels and Stay-Home-Notice hotels.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Navigation of the Website</h2>
                    <p>
                        The homepage is an interactive map with a layer control toggle and a search box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clicking on the layer control, you can see 6 different layers. 4 layers related to hotels and their status are in the primary layer group, and you can only select 1 layer from the list of 4.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The remaining 2 layers are in the secondary layer group: one for COVID-19 clusters and the other for dengue clusters
                    </p>
                    <h2>Legions of the Map</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are 4 icons within the map.

                    <li>The icon of red circle represents COVID-19 clusters from the COVID-19 layer.</li>
                    <li>The icon of blue polygon represents dengue fever clsuters from the dengue layer.</li>

                <h1>What is Covid-19?</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread
                        worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.</p>
                    <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people
                        who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe
                        symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms.
                        Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.</p>
                    <p>The source for the above information is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

                <h1>How is Singapore dealing with Covid-19?</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>Overall Singapore is dealing well with COVID-19. Death count and case count is low comparatively. Vaccination rate is close to 85% for the general population. The government is now pivoting to gradual openning and co-existing with
                        the virus.</p>
                    <p>Singapore Ministry of Health updates the COVID-19 situation daily. More information can be found in its official website: <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19">MOH COVID-19</a>.</p>

                <h1>What are Hotels Opened for Stay-Home-Notice?</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>Under Singapore government's current differentiated entry requirements for overseas visitors, visitors of certain profile may serve the Stay-Home-Notice of 10-14 days at home, given that their local residence fulfills certain criteria.
                        If such travellers' local residence do not fulfill such requirements, they can serve their Stay-Home-Notice at a list of approved hotels.</p>
                    <p>More information on Stay-Home-Notice can be found here: <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/shn">ICA Stay-Home-Notice</a></p>

                <h1>What are Hotels Approved for Staycation?</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>All the hotels were closed in Singapore during circuit breaker period in 2020, except those designated as quarantine facilities. In late 2020, hotels could apply for permission to re-open for leisure bookings, subject to stringent
                        requirements and inspection by the government to fulfill the new safety and hygiene standards. Such hotels are colloquially called staycation-approved hotels.</p>
                    <p>It's possible that a hotel is simultaneously approved for staycation (by Singapore residents) and for overseas travellers serving Stay-Home-Notice.</p>
                    <p>More information can be found here in Singapore Tourism Board's website: <a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/approved-hotels.html">STB Staycation Hotels</a></p>

                    <h1>What's Singapore's rules for overseas visitors?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Singapore government adopts a highly differentiated mechanism to cater to travellers from different countries, depending on the vaccinated status of the traveller, past travel history in the 21 days before arrival, overall COVID-19 situation of the country
                        of origin, fast-track lane arrangement etc. This is on top of visa and entry requirements.

                <article>
                    <p>Dengue fever is an illness caused by the dengue virus, transmittable only through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Unfortunately, the Aedes mosquito is one of the most common types of mosquito found in Singapore, and the dengue
                        fever epidemic remains a perennial issue.</p>
                    <p>Dengue symptoms include a fever (which can last up to 7 days), accompanied by intense headache, body aches, joint pains, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and skin rashes. Complete recovery can take up to a month.</p>
