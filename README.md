# 1. User Experience (UX)
## (i) Project Strategy
Following closely the objectives of this interactive map web application (i.e. to provide unstructured pandemic/endemic data into a visual map for easy selection and searching), these user goals were identified and served as guidelines for the features that were implemented.

(ii) Project Scope
The project skeleton and structure (wireframes) can be found here.

(iii) Design
The bootstrap framework was used in for the front-end development of the website as it allows for mobile responsive design and easy grid layout.

As the name of the web application suggests, 'Banarama', the colour palette and general design of the website takes after the colours of a banana (i.e. yellow, brown, black and green). As the focus of the project is a data-centric one, the layout of the webpage is not overly complex. Animated gifs were added to the website to enhance the visual experience of users.

2. Technologies Used
HTML 5
The project uses HTML5 to structure the content of the website.
CSS
The project uses CSS to add stylistic touches to the website.
Bootstrap
The project uses Bootstrap to structure the layout of the website (i.e. Navbar, Footer) and ensure website is mobile responsiveness.
Flask
The project uses the Flask web framework to develop the web application (i.e. Set up connection to MongoDB Atlas, process and validate forms and handle the uploading of files)
Jinja 2
The project uses Jinja2 to write conditional statements to display content blocks when certain conditions are met. Additionally, Jinja2 was used to set up template inherritance and extension of html/css files for the project.
MongoDB Atlas
The project uses MongoDB Atlas as a cloud database to store user data and file uploads.
GoogleFonts
The project uses GoogleFonts to style the typography on the website to enhance the visual experience of users.
FontAwesome 4.7
The project uses the icons provided by FontAwesome 4.7 alongside call-to-action buttons to enhance the user experience by making user interaction with the application more intuitive.
Heroku
The project uses Heroku for the deployment and management of the web application. As Heroku provides timelogs, when an error occurs, it makes easier to identity and remedy bugs.
3. Future Features To Implement
A feature for users to drag and drop files for uploads
Bulk uploading of files
Drag and drop files between albums
